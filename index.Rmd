### About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is Wayne, and I am an aspiring biostatistician. I want to help people make informed decisions about their health.  


### Education

I am a second year master's degree student studying  Biostatistics at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health. In 2021, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics. 


### Experience

From 2021 to 2023, I worked as a data scientist in First Republic Bank's anti-money laundering program. I built data pipelines and dashboards to make our data accessible and understandable. I designed and implemented machine learning models to identify unusual transactions.    

From 2023 to 2024, I worked on JP Morgan's CCOR Analytics team, focusing on cloud computing risks. I used machine learning models to identify vulnerabilities in cloud applications.
